# Azerothium Implementation Plan

## Outcome

Build the Black Empire vertical slice as a static, client-heavy historical atlas that proves four ideas together: a navigable 3D map, structured and source-aware lore records, data-driven guided history, and explicit causes and consequences. The MVP should be deployable from GitHub to Render without a server, database, authentication, or private credentials.

The reusable engine must not contain Black Empire-specific behavior. Black Empire records live in the data layer and exercise generic era, map-state, battle, story, source, and relationship systems.

## Current implementation status — 2026-10-01

The repository contains a complete reusable technical vertical slice and the first source-linked era baseline:

- Phase 0's parsed GeoJSON, external GLB terrain, coordinate adapter, camera rig, URL restoration, performance profile, and deep-link proof are implemented.
- Reusable Phase 1–5 systems are implemented: generated manifests and search, typed reference validation, source filtering, permanent dossiers, multi-record map layers, battle playback, guided-story persistence/branch return, causality, and provenance.
- Phase 6 foundations are implemented: route splitting, responsive states, error/WebGL fallbacks, accessibility affordances, privacy and asset-origin decisions, Render/GitHub Pages deployment configuration, and visual regression coverage.
- The root route is a cinematic, reduced-motion-safe landing page with a Mega Tour action and a calculated time estimate. The Mega Tour plays every era guide in data order, then continues through playable StoryTour entries in authored order; research previews stay out of playback. A second action opens the Tours hub for the Classic-to-Wrath story map and individual era tours.
- Chronicle Volumes 1–4 are registered as the editorial source backbone, with research templates, vocabulary, confidence rules, and a citation review checklist.
- Ten eras are present in the top-level selector with separate research map states. Era 0, **Cosmic Origins**, now has a source-linked public research preview built around a non-geographic relational cosmography, four events, ten indexed subjects, claim provenance, a continuous nine-node guided history, environmental representation for abstract cosmic subjects, and clickable visual representation for every key actor or embodied group. Their detailed, one-by-one research and production backlog lives in `docs/eras/README.md`.
- Era 1, **Primordial Azeroth and the Black Empire**, now has a source-linked public research preview: original generated terrain, inferred/approximate GeoJSON, 13 people/powers/places, four events, two conflict dossiers, a causal chain, a continuous unnumbered ten-node guided history, and clickable illustrated character overviews. Detailed battle phases remain in battle dossiers rather than interrupting the guided chronicle. Human citation and lore review still gates promotion to reviewed or published content.
- Era 2, **Ordering of Azeroth**, now has a source-linked public research preview with separate inherited and after-state terrain, eight events, a five-phase world-spanning campaign dossier, six new subjects, a cited causal handoff, and an unnumbered eleven-node guide paced for eventual slow narration. Aggramar, the titan-forged, and the keepers have original clickable visual representations; facilities and world-shaping processes are carried by terrain and accessible map labels. Human source, interpretation, and visual review still gates promotion.
- Era 3, **Rise of the Ancient Civilizations**, now has a source-linked public research preview with three political time states over one inherited primordial landmass, nine events, a four-phase troll–aqir conflict dossier, nine new subjects plus an expanded aqir record, an explicit causal handoff to the War of the Ancients, and an unnumbered twelve-node guide. Key troll, aqir, mogu, pandaren, dark troll, kaldorei, and Azshara beats have deliberate representation; broad research influence polygons remain in the source data but are not rendered as territory in guided scenes. Human source, chronology, cartography, interpretation, and visual review still gates promotion.
- Era 4, **The War of the Ancients and the Sundering**, now has a source-linked public research preview with inherited prewar terrain, a scarred invasion state, a separate post-Sundering world state, eight events, one five-phase strategic conflict dossier, 13 new subjects, two explicitly inferred routes, 18 source-aware relationships, and an unnumbered twelve-node guide. The Highborne, Legion, resistance, Malfurion, Tyrande, Illidan, Cenarius, Neltharion, Sargeras, and Azshara have deliberate clickable representation. Human source, chronology, cartography, interpretation, and visual review still gates promotion.
- Era 5, **The Long Vigil and the New Kingdoms**, now has a source-linked public research preview with three political time states over inherited post-Sundering terrain, 11 events, two five-phase strategic conflict dossiers, 16 new subjects, two explicitly inferred migration routes, source-aware relationships, and an unnumbered fourteen-node guide. The Long Vigil kaldorei, Highborne exiles, Dath'Remar, Amani, Arathor, Thoradin, and the three dwarven clans have deliberate clickable representation; uncertain wars and migrations are not presented as surveyed paths or exact battlefields. Human source, chronology, cartography, interpretation, and visual review still gates promotion.
- Era 6, **The Rise of the Horde and the First Two Wars**, now has a source-linked research preview with a new Draenor worldspace, intact and war-scarred Draenor terrain, separate First and Second War Azeroth states, 15 events, two strategic war dossiers, four explicitly inferred campaign routes, and an unnumbered fifteen-node cross-world guide. The Dark Portal is represented by corresponding local anchors and a deterministic map-state transition rather than a false geographic line between planets. Human source, chronology, cartography, interpretation, and visual review still gates promotion.
- Era 7, **The Third War and the Frozen Throne**, now has a source-linked research preview with four chronological theater states across Azeroth and a separate Outland worldspace, 15 events, two five-phase strategic conflict dossiers, seven explicitly inferred local routes, 25 time-aware spatial states, source-aware causality, and an unnumbered fifteen-node guide. The atlas changes map state between Azeroth and Outland rather than drawing a false cross-world route. Human source, chronology, cartography, interpretation, asset-provenance, and visual review still gates promotion.
- Era 8, **The Age of Adventurers**, now has a source-linked research preview with eight lazy map states across Azeroth, Outland, alternate Draenor, and Argus; ten era-guide beats; two five-phase strategic dossiers; source-aware causal handoffs; interpretive coalition visuals; and an unnumbered ten-node guide. Its separate Classic-to-Wrath StoryTour contains the 22-scene Dungeon Set 2, 20-scene Akama and Black Temple, 26-scene Cipher of Damnation, nine-scene Champion of the Naaru, and 17-scene Netherwing and 21-scene Shattered Sun and Sunwell research stories. Netherwing has its own relational TBC environments and contextual cast anchors, including Yarzill's drake reveal and the Shattrath handoff; its optional Murkblood branch and repeatable reputation interval stay distinct from the main chain. The Cataclysm is a separate major-change state and cross-world passages change worldspace without false geographic bridges. Human source, chronology, cartography, interpretation, asset-provenance, and visual review still gates promotion.
- Era 9, **The Modern Cosmic Age**, now has a source-linked, explicitly ongoing research preview with seven states across Azeroth and separate relational Shadowlands and K’aresh worldspaces; 13 events; two five-phase strategic dossiers; deliberate subject visuals; and an unnumbered 13-node guide. The released Midnight sequence includes the invasion, Darkwell, Dawnwell, and August 2026 Coiled Isle chapter. Later Worldsoul Saga outcomes remain open. Human source-freshness, chronology, cartography, interpretation, asset-provenance, and visual review still gates promotion.
- A repository-backed illustrated archive at `/archive` is generated from the validated lore dataset. It automatically includes every map state, entity, battle, and event; supports category and text filters; distinguishes dedicated illustrations from contextual map art; and restores the selected record through the URL. Its text-first detail view exposes lore, record facts, provenance, full dossiers, and atlas links without requiring WebGL.
- The text-first storyline library remains available at `/storylines`, and every playable Storyline reuses its validated StoryGuide for independent playback. Era tours contain era-guide nodes only; the Mega Tour plays all era guides before the playable entries in authored StoryTour order. The 22-placard Classic-to-Wrath StoryTour at `/tours/classic-to-wrath` adds a Wrath-era illustrated map with distinct clickable continents and an off-world Outland inset, authored story placards, individual story playback, and a chronological playlist across its completed guides. Preview placards remain outside both “Play all” and the Mega Tour. The Dragon in Stormwind, Scepter of the Shifting Sands, Dungeon Set 2: The Veiled Blade and Lord Valthalak, The Fallen Hero and Rakh’likh, Tirion and Taelan: Of Love and Family, Darrowshire: Lost and Remembered, The Defias and the Unsent Letter, The Scythe of Elune: The Original Mystery, Yeh'kinya, the Ancient Egg, and Hakkar, Ras Frostwhisper: a lich’s mortality, Karazhan: The Master’s Key and Nightbane, Akama and the Black Temple, Oronok and the Cipher of Damnation, Champion of the Naaru: Trials across Outland, Netherwing: Rescue, Disguise, and Liberation, The Missing Diplomat, The Shattered Sun and the restored Sunwell, and Quel’Delar: The Broken Blade Restored are its twenty-one playable stories; the Northrend Wrathgate remains a research preview. See `docs/decisions/separate-expansion-story-tours.md` and the updated `docs/research/storyline-build-template.md`. The tour and its interpretive map remain research pending source, edition, chronology, and visual review.
- The scene contract distinguishes terrain cartography from relational cosmography. Relational spatial states are validated as non-geographic and must explain their editorial composition; reusable rendering contains no era-ID branches. `visualPresence` lets a figure appear only during a relevant story beat. Optional `mapFigure.eraVariants` support time-appropriate portraits for one stable lore entity; the renderer uses the current spatial state’s era and falls back to the entity’s default image. See `docs/decisions/time-aware-character-figures.md`.
- Optional guided voice-over is implemented for all 121 era-guide StoryNodes and every node in the twenty-one playable Classic-to-Wrath StoryTour stories, including Netherwing: 501 repository-backed MP3 tracks with opt-in persistent controls, visible transcripts, AI disclosure, deterministic Gradio generation, provenance and hash manifests, missing-asset validation, interruption behavior, and browser coverage for on/off/re-enable and chapter changes. It narrates guided-tour text only.

The reusable engine acceptance path and all ten Era 0–9 research-preview implementations are complete. This authorizes explicitly labeled public previews, not promotion of the records to `published`: every era still requires human review of its claim-level citations, original summaries, interpretive visuals, stories, and causal chains. Era 9 also remains deliberately open-ended as Warcraft's current history develops, and production-scale label density remains a future measurement gate.

## Architectural decisions

### Application and routing

- Use Vite, React, and strict TypeScript as a single-page application.
- Use `/` as the public entry to the Mega Tour and Tours hub. `/map?era=<slug>&tour=full|era` is the shareable, noninteractive guided scene; `/archive` is the generated asset gallery. The tour-led decision is recorded in `docs/decisions/tour-led-public-experience.md` and the Mega Tour sequence in `docs/decisions/mega-tour-composition.md`.
- Use React Router with permanent routes for `/eras/:slug`, `/battles/:slug`, `/events/:slug`, `/locations/:slug`, and `/factions/:slug`.
- Use `/map` query parameters for restorable explorer state: `era`, selected record, and optionally a compact camera bookmark. Public layer visibility is curated by era and story state rather than exposed as visitor configuration.
- Keep the 3D explorer client-rendered. Generate static dossier HTML only after measuring an actual search-indexing or link-preview need. If needed, add a build-time prerender step rather than a server runtime.
- Configure the static host to rewrite unknown routes to `/index.html` so browser refreshes work.

### State boundaries

- Keep durable content outside Zustand. The repository adapter owns content reads.
- Use small stores for `era`, `selection`, internal `layers`, `story`, provenance scope, and `mapView`. Layer and source-filter boundaries support the engine and editorial tooling; they are not public explorer controls.
- Treat the URL as shareable state and synchronize it at route boundaries, not every animation frame.
- Keep high-frequency camera and pointer state inside Three.js controls/refs. React stores receive only meaningful settled state.
- Persist story guide ID and node ID in session storage after the story behavior stabilizes. Do not persist transient timer or animation progress.

### Scene graph

```text
MapViewport3D
├─ CameraRig
├─ WorldspaceScene
│  ├─ Terrain
│  ├─ Ocean
│  ├─ RegionLayer
│  ├─ BorderLayer
│  ├─ RouteLayer
│  ├─ MarkerLayer
│  └─ LabelLayer
├─ StoryEffects
└─ InteractionController
```

- One scene represents the active worldspace and map state.
- Layer renderers consume normalized selectors rather than raw files.
- Batch repeated marker geometry and materials; use instancing when measurements justify it.
- Story effects are temporary overlays keyed by action IDs, separate from durable geography.
- Dispose loaded textures, geometries, and materials when switching heavy worldspace assets.

### Coordinate convention

- Author vectors in a worldspace-local `0..10000` two-dimensional atlas coordinate system.
- Record the authoring origin on each worldspace. The initial convention is bottom-left.
- Convert atlas X/Y to centered Three.js X/Z coordinates through one tested function.
- Reserve Three.js Y for elevation and overlay offsets.
- Never label these values as latitude or longitude.
- Store source-space geometry unchanged; optimization scripts produce derived runtime assets.

### GeoJSON and terrain

- Author points, routes, borders, and regions as GeoJSON.
- Validate bounds and feature IDs at build time.
- Convert polygons to triangulated `BufferGeometry`, lines to shared/batched line geometry, and points to instanced markers in a build step once real geometry is available.
- Begin with a low-poly GLB terrain mesh plus compressed KTX2 textures. Use Draco or Meshopt only after profiling decode and transfer costs.
- Keep terrain assets under `public/models/<worldspace>/<map-state>/` so they load by URL and never enter the main JavaScript chunk.
- Use separate map-state assets for major geographic changes. Defer continent morphing.

### Labels

- Use Drei HTML labels for the spike because they are accessible and fast to iterate.
- Before MVP lock, compare HTML labels with signed-distance-field text under realistic label counts.
- Retain HTML for selected/interactive labels and dossiers even if dense ambient labels move to SDF rendering.
- Apply deterministic priority, collision, distance, and layer rules. Never render every label unconditionally.

### Camera control

- Use OrbitControls for free exploration with bounded distance and polar angles.
- Add a `CameraRig` that interpolates position and target for scripted story instructions.
- Story camera commands can be skipped and must land at the same deterministic final pose.
- User input cancels the current interpolation without corrupting StoryNode progress.
- Reduced-motion mode applies the final pose immediately.

### Story engine

- A StoryGuide owns an ordered graph of StoryNodes; nodes contain narration, optional branches, a camera instruction, and VisualActions.
- A pure interpreter maps each VisualAction to explicit ports such as `setLayer`, `selectBattle`, `showRoute`, and `focusLocation`.
- Unsupported action types fail validation during development and fail visibly but safely at runtime.
- Entering a node applies actions idempotently from a known scene state.
- The public tour card is an unnumbered continuous sequence containing only Previous and Next controls plus a visible bottom-edge chapter timer; narration and timed map changes carry the story without archive-control clutter or embedded conflict sub-stories.
- Reusable branch-return state remains available to future tours, but the Black Empire tour keeps optional dossiers separate from the guided sequence. Clicking a map figure outside the tour opens a concise reader-facing overview; research and provenance detail remains on permanent routes.
- Tests cover every action type, node transitions, skip behavior, and branch-and-return state.
- Node narration remains the accessible transcript and canonical voice-over script. Optional repository-backed audio may enhance a node, but never replaces the text or its skip/reduced-motion behavior. Voice preference is separate from story progress, and narration must stop cleanly on disable, chapter change, guide exit, or era change.
- Guided playback uses the whole viewport with a borderless narration area and compact controls. Terrain boundaries fade into a non-geographic atmospheric backdrop derived from the existing map art; authored coordinates and camera commands remain unchanged. Only relevant character figures appear during story beats. The persistent return-to-atlas action ends playback and restores navigation, timeline, and dossiers. This is reusable Phase 4/6 presentation work; transcripts remain keyboard-scrollable at compact and landscape sizes.
- The public app is named **Azerothium**. Guided narration tells the history directly rather than naming the source books; their exact titles remain in citations. Existing storage keys, source IDs, repository URLs, and deployment identifiers are retained for compatibility. Story framing adjusts the camera projection above the transcript without changing authored camera poses or geographic anchors.
- Guided environments use closer landscape and portrait framing, with full-viewport atmosphere from the active map asset. Relational scenes crop the atmospheric texture separately from the anchored field; terrain backdrops remain softly defocused so they do not imply additional mapped geography. Figure sizing compensates for projection magnification to preserve room for dense casts. This is reusable Phase 4/6 presentation work, with desktop, tablet, phone, landscape, and crowded-chapter browser coverage.
- Full-history playback automatically advances between guided eras after the final chapter's audio or silent-reading timer completes, and ends at the coverage message after the last era. Pausing also pauses the era handoff. The compact voice toggle sits beside the return action in the world header; narration disclosure is available on hover or keyboard focus. Map note overlays are removed; record-level certainty and provenance remain available in the archive and dossiers.
- Guided prose stays within the historical telling. Cartographic approximations, symbolic compositions, renderer terminology, and source-analysis asides belong in the supporting records rather than the spoken transcript. Omit unsupported details instead of assigning unknown motives, exact locations, or outcomes. The Phase 4 narration pass replaces 43 passages across all ten guided eras and regenerates their corresponding audio; the remaining 74 recordings are retained.
- Phase 4 storyline prose follows the original Tolkien-esque era voice across library summaries, openings, text-first chapters, and playback. Quests, objectives, player instructions, loot/reward systems, reputation gates, raid-entry rules, game versions, and editorial source analysis belong in supporting research records. Text-first chapters use the same narrative as their StoryGuide; previews remain explicitly unfinished research. Every revised transcript receives regenerated audio with matching hashes. See `docs/research/story-prose-refresh.md` for the corpus audit and retained editorial caveats.

### Battle playback

- Represent battle playback as ordered phases with duration, narration, camera instruction, and route/region/marker actions.
- Build it on the same interpreter and animation scheduler used by StoryNodes.
- Playback is historical cartography, not unit simulation.
- Controls are play, pause, previous phase, next phase, restart, and skip to result.
- The final state is deterministic and can be shown immediately for reduced-motion users.

### Causal graph

- Model relationships as source-aware edges, with `fromId`, `toId`, relationship type, citation IDs, and confidence.
- Build adjacency lists at load time and use custom breadth-first traversal for immediate causes/consequences.
- Render the MVP graph with React Flow only if interaction requirements exceed a compact custom SVG. Start with custom SVG to minimize weight and retain styling control.
- Detect unintended causal cycles in validation while allowing explicitly flagged non-causal relationship cycles.

### Provenance

- A Source identifies a work; a Citation identifies a location inside that work; a Claim identifies an assertion with confidence and status.
- Published, active, non-speculative claims require at least one citation.
- Inferred map placement requires a visible geographic-certainty label and an editor note.
- Conflicting claims remain separate records; do not overwrite one claim with another.
- Public summaries are paraphrases. Research notes and copied excerpts remain outside public build inputs.

### Search

- Generate a compact JSON index during the build from validated publishable records.
- Start with normalized tokens and weighted fields: name, alias, type, era, tags, and short description.
- Use a small client-side library only if measured search quality requires fuzzy ranking.
- Search results link to permanent dossiers and include an atlas action that restores era and selection.

### Testing

- Vitest: schemas, date helpers, coordinates, graph traversal, source filtering, and story interpreter.
- Testing Library: curated layer visibility, dossier accessibility, guide progression, URL synchronization, and error states.
- Playwright in Phase 4: load Black Empire, open a concise marker overview, complete the unnumbered guide without embedded battle playback, verify permanent battle playback separately, and inspect provenance on permanent routes.
- Visual regression in Phase 6 for the application shell and key dossier states; avoid pixel-locking the animated canvas.
- Build validation fails on broken references, duplicate IDs/slugs, invalid bounds, missing required citations, and unintended causal cycles.

### Assets and caching

- Code-split by top-level route and lazy-load worldspace/map-state scene modules.
- Load heavy GLB/KTX2/GeoJSON assets by URL with immutable content hashes once the pipeline exists.
- Cache decoded assets in the browser session; do not keep all worldspaces resident.
- Set the initial CDN threshold after measurement. A starting decision gate is any single asset over 10 MB compressed or total static assets over 100 MB.
- Move heavy assets to object storage/CDN when repository size, clone time, or host bandwidth becomes painful; preserve URLs behind an asset manifest.

### Deployment and future backend

- Deploy the MVP as a Render Static Site from GitHub. GitHub Pages remains a prototype fallback.
- Do not introduce Supabase/Postgres, authentication, or an API until a concrete feature requires server state.
- Backend triggers include user accounts, bookmarks synchronized across devices, browser-based editing, contributions, private credentials, collaborative review, or spatial queries too large for the client.
- A future `PostgresLoreRepository` must implement the same read interface as `StaticLoreRepository`. UI and scene selectors must not depend on file paths.
- PostGIS stores source geometry; the build/cache layer can still serve optimized client assets.

### Content authoring workflow

The initial editorial timeline is grounded in *World of Warcraft: Chronicle* Volumes 1–4. Treat each volume as a source scope, not as an in-world era by itself: era records and boundaries must be derived from the chronology after human citation review. Where the volumes conflict or revise an account, preserve separate claims and label the dispute or supersession.

```text
source material
→ human research notes
→ candidate JSON or YAML records
→ schema and reference validation
→ human lore and citation review
→ reviewed repository data
→ generated indexes and map assets
→ application
```

- Keep one record per file while content is small and review-driven.
- Use stable kebab-case IDs that do not encode display names likely to change.
- Add `contentStatus` and exclude non-published records from production when real content entry begins.
- QGIS is the vector-authoring tool; Blender is reserved for terrain and exceptional 3D assets.

## Delivery phases

### Phase 0 Renderer and coordinate spike

Reusable engine work:

- Replace the decorative region with one parsed GeoJSON polygon.
- Add a tested GeoJSON-to-world coordinate pipeline.
- Load one rough GLB terrain/map mesh outside the JavaScript bundle.
- Add one point marker, polygon, route, label, selection focus, and scripted camera move.

Acceptance criteria:

- Content can be added without editing UI code.
- Every record parses and every cross-reference validates in CI.
- Reviewed claims display at least one resolvable citation.
- Placeholder and research records can be excluded from a production build.

### Phase 2 Explorer UI

- Implement URL synchronization for era and selection.

Black Empire content work:

- Add reviewed primary region/domain geometry, 10-20 important records, and initial labels.
- Define the era's default layer set and label priorities.

Acceptance criteria:

- A user can enter Black Empire, navigate the map, see the curated historical layers, and open dossiers.
- Dossiers remain usable without interacting with the 3D canvas.
- Shared URLs restore the same era and selection.
- Archive URLs restore the same category, search, and enlarged record, and each entry links back to its permanent dossier or atlas context.

### Phase 3 Battle system

Reusable engine work:

- Complete battle, combatant, objective, phase, outcome, and certainty UI.
- Add importance and certainty markers that do not rely on color alone.
- Implement deterministic phase playback with skip and reduced motion.

Acceptance criteria:

- Experience the Era runs end-to-end.
- The map reacts to every node from data, not node-specific React code.
- The guide never opens a nested story or conflict playback; map dossiers remain independently accessible.
- Keyboard and reduced-motion users can complete the guide.

### Phase 5 Causality and sources

Reusable engine work:

- Implement cause/consequence traversal and visualization.
- Add confidence, claim status, citations, and curated publication scope to dossiers and map selectors.

- Complete lore review, copy edit, citation audit, asset-origin audit, and unofficial-project notices.
- Remove or exclude every unreviewed fixture from production.

Acceptance criteria:

- All MVP Definition of Done scenarios pass in production.
- The useful scene appears within the measured performance budget on the target desktop profile.
- No important information is available only through color, motion, hover, or the 3D canvas.
- The public build contains no scans, bulk copied prose, unreviewed claims, or unlabeled inference.

## Immediate backlog status

1. [x] Add the renderer spike record at `docs/spikes/renderer.md`.
2. [x] Replace inline geometry with parsed GeoJSON fixtures.
3. [x] Build and test the Polygon, LineString, and Point geometry adapter.
4. [x] Add `CameraRig` and a cancellable story-camera command port.
5. [x] Add and measure a reproducible external GLB terrain fixture.
6. [x] Lazy-load the map route and inspect production chunks.
7. [x] Cover URL-to-selection synchronization.
8. [x] Add a dossier-linked WebGL fallback.
9. [x] Record the desktop performance profile and budgets.
10. [x] Create research, glossary, confidence, source-inventory, and citation-review documents.

### Next content-gated work

1. A human researcher records edition details and exact citation locations from Chronicle Volumes 1–4.
2. A human lore reviewer approves the first small era/entity/location/event/claim sample.
3. Reviewed records promote the research dataset through the generated manifest path; removed technical fixtures never return as lore.
4. Reviewed Black Empire geometry, battle dossiers, an 8–15 node guide, and a causal chain are authored only where those citations support them.
5. Final label-density, terrain, transfer, and visual measurements run against the reviewed content volume.
6. Deployment switches to `VITE_CONTENT_MODE=published` only when the published dataset passes the MVP completion gate; no placeholder or research records ship in that build.

## Technical risks and experiments

| Risk | Earliest experiment | Decision signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTML labels become expensive or overlap heavily | Render 250 representative labels with priority rules | Move ambient labels to SDF if layout or frame time misses budget |
| GeoJSON triangulation produces artifacts | Test concave polygons and holes from QGIS exports | Adopt a preprocessing library/build step before content scales |
| Camera scripting fights OrbitControls | Cancel and resume animations under repeated user input | Separate free-camera and scripted-camera controllers if state leaks |
| React state causes frame-time spikes | Profile camera motion with React DevTools and browser performance tools | Keep all frame state in refs; expose settled events only |
| Static dossier pages lack useful previews | Test deployed links in target crawlers | Add build-time prerendering, not a server, if previews matter |
| Lore records become too fragmented | Conduct a review with 20 realistic records | Generate authoring manifests or adopt YAML without changing runtime schemas |
| Repository assets become too large | Measure clone, CI, deploy, and first-load sizes | Move hashed heavy assets behind an asset manifest/CDN |
| Uncertainty is mistaken for canon | User-test certainty markers and wording | Strengthen non-color indicators and block publishing without review metadata |

## MVP completion gate

The MVP is complete only when a new user can identify the Black Empire era, navigate the 3D world, inspect a character overview and sourced battle, complete one continuous guided story, inspect causes and consequences, distinguish certainty states, and reach the next historical state—while the same information remains accessible through permanent text-first routes.


## Independent StoryTours (Phase 4 extension)

See `docs/decisions/separate-expansion-story-tours.md` and `docs/decisions/mega-tour-composition.md`. EraTour playback remains era-only. The Mega Tour composes all era guides followed by playable stops from validated StoryTour records; an individual StoryTour still owns its chronological Storyline placards, map regions, and “Play all” itinerary. Existing StoryGuide nodes and audio are reused, and research previews remain browseable but are never inserted into playback. The earlier storyline-placement model remains documented as historical context in `docs/decisions/integrated-tour-library.md`.
