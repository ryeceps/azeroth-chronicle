# Historical Atlas Build Program

## Purpose and editorial status

This is the implementation and research backlog for the ten current navigation eras, beginning with the Cosmic Origins prologue. The era names and summaries are approved product taxonomy; every person, place, boundary, date, battle, route, outcome, and causal link listed below remains a **research candidate** until it has claim-level citations and human lore review. The cross-era [master lore backlog](../research/master-lore-backlog.md) collects additional candidate stories and first-party source leads.

Application records live in `data/eras`. Each era owns a separate record in `data/map-states`, because the atlas must not imply that Azeroth had one permanent geography. Reviewed people and factions will live in `data/entities`; events and battles in `data/events` and `data/battles`; time-aware placements in `data/spatial-states`; routes and source geometry in `data/routes` and `data/geometry`; narrated sequences in `data/stories`. Cross-era storyline research outlines live in `data/storylines` and appear through the era-linked [storyline library](../../src/pages/StorylineLibraryPage.tsx).

## Build order and current state

| Order | Era ID | Primary atlas problem | Current state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `cosmic-origins` | Non-geographic cosmic forces and the formation of Azeroth | Public research-preview vertical slice implemented; human review pending |
| 1 | `black-empire` | Primordial Azeroth, elemental domains, and Black Empire influence | Public research-preview vertical slice implemented; human review pending |
| 2 | `ordering-of-azeroth` | Titan-forged campaigns and planetary reordering | Public research-preview vertical slice implemented; human review pending |
| 3 | `ancient-civilizations` | Changing empires across primordial Kalimdor | Public research-preview vertical slice implemented; human review pending |
| 4 | `war-of-the-ancients` | A campaign ending in a world-changing rupture | Public research-preview vertical slice implemented; human review pending |
| 5 | `long-vigil-new-kingdoms` | Post-Sundering states, migrations, and borders | Public research-preview vertical slice implemented; human review pending |
| 6 | `rise-of-the-horde` | Two worlds, the Dark Portal, and two wars | Public research-preview vertical slice implemented; human review pending |
| 7 | `third-war-frozen-throne` | Multi-front collapse and the path to Icecrown | Public research-preview vertical slice implemented; human review pending |
| 8 | `age-of-adventurers` | Many campaigns and repeated map-state changes | Source-linked research preview; human review pending |
| 9 | `modern-cosmic-age` | Fourth War through the evolving Worldsoul Saga | Source-linked research preview through August 2026 |

Build the eras in this order. Cosmic Origins through the First Two Wars now establish the reference patterns for relational cosmography, terrain eras, explicit before/after storytelling, long eras represented through political time slices, irreversible world-state transitions, inferred migrations, concurrent regional histories, and cross-world transitions without shared coordinates. Finish the publication gate for one era before beginning production terrain for the next; reusable engine improvements may continue across eras.

## Definition of done for every era

1. Record the exact editions used and produce a claim ledger with chapter/page or first-party game-source citations.
2. Resolve the era boundary, chronology, disputed accounts, and geography confidence through human review.
3. Create a terrain brief, one or more map states where geography materially changes, and source GeoJSON. Unknown locations receive no exact marker.
4. Add only cited characters, factions, locations, events, battles, phases, routes, outcomes, and causal relationships.
5. Author an original-paraphrase guided tour. Every node has transcript text, duration, camera framing, highlighted subjects, and deterministic visual actions.
6. Verify timed autoplay, previous/next, the visible chapter timer, manual exploration through optional dossiers, reduced motion, keyboard access, deep links, and WebGL fallback.
7. Pass lore validation, focused tests, `pnpm check`, `pnpm build`, and a human editorial review.

## Source strategy

Chronicle Volumes 1–4 are the backbone, but volume boundaries are not era boundaries. Volume 1's publisher announcement describes a span from the creation of the Warcraft universe through *Warcraft: Orcs & Humans*, which makes it the starting research source for eras 1–6. The [Warcraft Wiki Chronicle Volume 1 index](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Chronicle_Volume_1) supplies the project's working topic, chart, reference, and map index until the complete book is available. Volumes 2–4 must receive edition-specific chapter/page indexing before their coverage is assigned at claim level. Dark Horse describes Volume 4 as covering *Mists of Pandaria*, *Warlords of Draenor*, *Legion*, *Battle for Azeroth*, and *Shadowlands*.

Era 9 extends beyond Chronicle Volume 4. Dragonflight and Worldsoul Saga material therefore requires first-party Blizzard sources and in-game citations rather than being attributed to Chronicle. Useful first-party research entry points include Blizzard's [Dragonflight overview](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23785116), [Dragon Aspects history](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23876527), [Visions of N'Zoth overview](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23237904), and [Worldsoul Saga announcement](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24025826). These links seed research only; they are not substitutes for claim-level citations.

## Era 0 — Cosmic Origins

**Historical question:** What powers and processes shaped the Warcraft cosmos, world-souls, and the conditions from which Azeroth emerged?

**Release boundary:** the prologue is present as a complete public research preview with a sourced boundary, coherent guided sequence, and purpose-built relational visualization. Human citation and perspective review still gates promotion beyond `research`.

**Visualization direction:** use a non-geographic cosmic field and relationship-driven composition rather than painting Light, Shadow, Life, Death, Order, or Disorder onto Azeroth as territorial regions. The sequence should narrow from cosmic forces to the physical universe, world-souls, and finally Azeroth, handing off at the elemental imbalance. Do not force cosmic subjects into planetary coordinates.

**Voice-over sequencing:** write and stabilize the transcript with the other eras, but defer recording and audio synchronization until every slice is complete.

**Implemented research baseline:** ten indexed subjects, four events, four relationship edges, original cosmography and Aman’Thul figure, claim-level provenance, and a nine-pane tour. The detailed audit is in `docs/research/era-0-cosmic-origins.md`.

## Era 1 — Primordial Azeroth and the Black Empire

**Historical question:** How did Azeroth's world-soul, the elemental conflicts, and the Old Gods produce the world ruled by the Black Empire?

**Research packets:** primordial Azeroth terrain; elemental powers and domains; Old Gods and Black Empire control; world-soul claims; sequence and causality. The opening cosmic frame supplies only the context needed to understand Azeroth and is not presented as a complete cosmic history. Candidate people/factions, named locations, conflicts, and boundaries must come from reviewed Volume 1 citations.

**Map production:** maintain the deliberately non-Earth, primordial Azeroth research terrain; reveal one contextual overlay, site, route, or conflict focus at a time instead of stacking every available layer; distinguish exact, approximate, inferred, and unknown geography; do not force cosmic locations onto the planetary map. The Chronicle maps indexed by Warcraft Wiki may guide reconstruction, but the application must use original simplified geometry rather than copied map art unless Blizzard grants explicit redistribution permission.

**Animated tour spine:** brief cosmic context → Azeroth's world-soul and elemental imbalance → elemental world → escalation of conflict → arrival/rise of the Old Gods → Black Empire domains → condition of the world before the ordering. Camera moves should begin wide, descend to world scale, reveal domains in sequence, animate only cited campaign routes, and finish in the exact map state inherited by Era 2.

**Implemented research baseline:** 13 people/powers/places, four events, two supported conflict groupings, an original source-guided terrain state, claim-level provenance, and a ten-node tour. The detailed source and cartography audit is in `docs/research/era-1-black-empire.md`. Human review remains required before promotion.

## Era 2 — Ordering of Azeroth

**Historical question:** How did the Titan-forged campaign alter political control, containment, and the physical world?

**Release boundary:** the slice begins with the Black Empire world inherited from Era 1 and ends after the Pantheon leaves its safeguards and servants to preserve the ordered world. Later keeper conflicts, Galakrond, the Dragon Aspects, and the rise of mortal civilizations belong to subsequent research. Every record remains a public `research` preview until a human verifies the cited edition pages, perspective, and cartographic interpretation.

**Research packets:** Titan-forged forces and command relationships; Old God confrontations and imprisonments; keeper facilities; Ulduar; the Well of Eternity; ordering works; before/after geography; consequences inherited by later civilizations.

**Map production:** preserve Era 1 as the before-state and create a distinct ordered-Azeroth after-state. The tour may switch between them; it must not morph continents unless later measurements justify that feature. Facility markers and campaign paths need explicit geography confidence.

**Animated tour spine:** inherited Black Empire map → Titan-forged arrival → campaign fronts → pivotal confrontations → containment network → reshaped world and facilities → Well of Eternity → handoff to emerging civilizations.

**Voice-over sequencing:** the eleven transcripts are timed for a slow, weighty delivery of roughly 82 words per minute plus breathing room. Recording and final audio synchronization remain deferred until all historical slices are stable.

**Implemented research baseline:** six new indexed subjects, eight events, a five-phase campaign dossier, 11 source-aware relationships, 12 time-aware spatial states, separate before/after terrain, original actor visuals, and an eleven-pane guide. The detailed source, geography, and visual audit is in `docs/research/era-2-ordering-of-azeroth.md`.

**Completion emphasis:** the final scene must make the causal transition to Era 3 visible, with source-backed relationships rather than narration alone.

## Era 3 — Rise of the Ancient Civilizations

**Historical question:** Where did ancient powers emerge, expand, split, and collide before the War of the Ancients?

**Research packets:** troll polities and successor empires; aqir wars and divisions; mogu and Pandaria; early human development; kaldorei ascent; migration and control changes; contested chronology and terminology.

**Map production:** a primordial Kalimdor political atlas with time slices when borders change materially. Use region polygons for influence only when supportable; otherwise use labeled centers, uncertain extents, and routes. Avoid implying precise borders from prose that supports only broad regions.

**Animated tour spine:** ordered world → first centers of power → troll expansion → aqir conflict fronts → southern/eastern civilizations → kaldorei ascent → concentration around the Well → tensions that lead into Era 4.

**Completion emphasis:** favor a small number of defensible map snapshots over one visually busy composite of thousands of years.

**Implemented research baseline:** nine new indexed subjects plus an expanded aqir record, nine events, one four-phase strategic conflict dossier, three political map states, 14 source-aware relationship edges, 11 time-aware spatial states, original terrain and actor visuals, and a twelve-pane guided history. The detailed source, geography, scope, and visual audit is in `docs/research/era-3-ancient-civilizations.md`. Human review remains required before promotion.

## Era 4 — The War of the Ancients and the Sundering

**Historical question:** How did political choices around the Well enable invasion, resistance, and the rupture of primordial Kalimdor?

**Research packets:** Queen Azshara and court; resistance and allied forces; Burning Legion command; invasion sequence; major engagements and routes; Well of Eternity; causal chain to the Sundering; survivors and migrations.

**Map production:** at minimum, create pre-invasion primordial Kalimdor and post-Sundering world map states. Add intermediate campaign states only when they make the narrative clearer. Treat the Sundering as a deterministic state change with reduced-motion skip, not a decorative looping effect.

**Animated tour spine:** kaldorei high point → decisions at the Well → invasion opens → fronts spread → resistance converges → final confrontation → Sundering transition → survivor routes and new continents.

**Completion emphasis:** this era is the reference implementation for major world change and must prove that stories can switch map states without losing transcript, selection, or tour progress.

**Implemented research baseline:** 13 new indexed subjects, eight events, one five-phase strategic conflict dossier, three terrain states, two inferred routes, 18 source-aware relationship edges, 15 time-aware spatial states, original terrain and actor visuals, and a twelve-pane guided history. The detailed source, geography, interaction, and visual audit is in `docs/research/era-4-war-of-the-ancients.md`. Human review remains required before promotion.

## Era 5 — The Long Vigil and the New Kingdoms

**Historical question:** How did peoples resettle, establish kingdoms, and change control across the post-Sundering world?

**Research packets:** Long Vigil; Quel'Thalas; Arathor and successor kingdoms; Khaz Modan; migrations; political boundaries; alliances and conflicts; dates and boundary ambiguity.

**Map production:** use post-Sundering continental terrain with several political time slices instead of one timeless kingdom map. Animate migrations and territorial transitions only where routes can be defended. Keep Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms readable at atlas scale.

**Animated tour spine:** immediate post-Sundering world → Long Vigil → major migrations → founding centers → consolidation of kingdoms → fragmentation and new powers → geopolitical world inherited by the Horde's rise.

**Completion emphasis:** prove that one era can contain sub-period navigation while remaining one understandable top-level selection.

**Implemented research baseline:** 16 new indexed subjects plus returning figures and places, 11 events, two five-phase strategic conflict dossiers, three political map states, two inferred routes, 22 time-aware spatial states, original actor visuals, and a fourteen-pane guided history. The map carries the Long Vigil, Highborne exile and eastward migration, overlapping Amani and Quel'Thalas claims, Arathor and the Troll Wars, seven successor kingdoms, and the War of the Three Hammers without inventing precise battlefields or surveyed borders. The detailed source, causality, cartography, interaction, and visual audit is in `docs/research/era-5-long-vigil-new-kingdoms.md`. Human review remains required before promotion.

## Era 6 — The Rise of the Horde and the First Two Wars

**Historical question:** How did events on Draenor cause the Dark Portal invasion and reshape the Eastern Kingdoms through two wars?

**Research packets:** Draenor before corruption; clans and Legion influence; Horde formation; Dark Portal; First War campaigns and Stormwind; Second War fronts; Alliance response; outcomes and aftermath. Chronicle Volumes 1 and 2 are candidate starting sources, with exact division determined by the source index.

**Map production:** this era needs at least two worldspaces or clearly separated theater maps—Draenor and Azeroth—plus portal linkage. Campaign routes should be phase-aware. Never draw the portal transition as an ordinary geographic line between coordinate systems.

**Animated tour spine:** Draenor baseline → corruption and consolidation → portal opens → First War routes → Stormwind outcome → Alliance formation/response → Second War fronts → Alliance victory and consequences.

**Completion emphasis:** prove cross-world storytelling while preserving local atlas coordinates and meaningful back/forward navigation.

**Implemented research baseline:** a new Draenor worldspace; original intact and war-scarred terrain; separate First and Second War states on inherited Azeroth terrain; 22 new indexed subjects plus the returning seven kingdoms; 15 events; two strategic war dossiers with five and seven phases; four inferred intra-world routes; 23 time-aware spatial states; and a fifteen-pane guided history. The Dark Portal is shown through local anchors and a map-state transition, never as a line between planetary coordinate systems. The detailed source, causality, cartography, interaction, and visual audit is in `docs/research/era-6-rise-of-the-horde.md`. Human review remains required before promotion.

## Era 7 — The Third War and the Frozen Throne

**Historical question:** How did the Scourge crisis, Arthas's choices, and the Legion's return collapse kingdoms and establish a new power in Icecrown?

**Research packets:** plague and Scourge; Arthas's arc; Lordaeron and Quel'Thalas; Legion invasion; migrations to Kalimdor; Mount Hyjal; Northrend and Frozen Throne sequence; resulting factions and control.

**Map production:** build Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, and Northrend theater states with a legible chronological progression. Use city-state changes and destruction states sparingly but clearly. Long-distance movements need route phases and source confidence.

**Animated tour spine:** northern crisis → Arthas's decisions → Lordaeron collapse → Quel'Thalas campaign → Legion return → westward convergence → Mount Hyjal → race to Icecrown → new order at the Frozen Throne.

**Completion emphasis:** this is the stress test for intertwined character, faction, battle, and causal stories without turning the atlas into tactical simulation.

**Implemented research baseline:** an Outland worldspace; four chronological theater states across Azeroth and Outland; 15 events; two five-phase strategic conflict dossiers; seven inferred local routes; 25 time-aware spatial states; source-aware causal relationships; original actor and embodied-group visuals; and a fifteen-pane guided history. Cross-world transitions change map state without drawing false geographic lines. The detailed source, causality, cartography, interaction, and visual audit is in `docs/research/era-7-third-war-frozen-throne.md`. Human review remains required before promotion.

## Era 8 — The Age of Adventurers

**Historical question:** How did successive campaigns transform Azeroth and its relationships from the opening of World of Warcraft through Legion?

**Research packets:** renewed faction conflict; Ahn'Qiraj; Outland; Northrend; Cataclysm; Pandaria; alternate Draenor; Legion. Establish a strict editorial boundary with Era 9 and a source ledger spanning Chronicle Volumes 3–4 plus first-party game records where needed.

**Map production:** treat this as a container era with selectable sub-periods and separate states for material geographic changes, especially pre-/post-Cataclysm. Outland, Northrend, Pandaria, alternate Draenor, and Legion theaters should lazy-load; do not combine them into one scene.

**Animated tour spine:** launch-era world → Ahn'Qiraj → Outland → Northrend → Cataclysm state change → Pandaria → alternate Draenor → Legion invasion and resolution → wounded-world handoff to Era 9.

**Completion emphasis:** define a sub-era data pattern before content production. The top selector remains ten eras; a secondary chapter control handles expansion-scale stories inside this era.

**Implemented research baseline:** eight lazy map states across Azeroth, Outland, alternate Draenor, and Argus; ten events; two five-phase strategic dossiers; source-aware causal handoffs; new interpretive coalition visuals; and a ten-pane guided history. The Cataclysm uses a separate major-change terrain state, while every cross-world passage changes worldspace without a geographic bridge. The compact preview uses tour nodes as the MVP's secondary chronological chapter pattern rather than introducing another store or engine concept. See `docs/research/era-8-age-of-adventurers.md` for the source, cartography, visual, and human-review audit.

## Era 9 — The Modern Cosmic Age

**Historical question:** How do the Fourth War, N'Zoth, the Shadowlands, the Dragon Isles, and the Worldsoul Saga increasingly center Azeroth itself?

**Research packets:** Fourth War fronts; N'Zoth's release and assaults; Shadowlands theaters; Dragon Isles awakening; current Worldsoul Saga chapters; retcons and evolving claims. Chronicle Volume 4 is a candidate source through Shadowlands, while later claims require current first-party sources and in-game evidence.

**Map production:** use separate worldspaces for non-Azeroth realms and separate Azeroth states where control or geography changes. Dragon Isles terrain should load independently. Current-saga material needs a visible cutoff date/version so the atlas never presents an evolving storyline as complete.

**Animated tour spine:** Fourth War escalation → faction-war consequences → N'Zoth threat → Shadowlands transition → return to Azeroth → Dragon Isles awakening → world-soul focus → current Worldsoul chapter → explicit “ongoing record” ending.

**Completion emphasis:** add a source freshness review and an “ongoing” status before publication. Never infer unreleased outcomes.

**Implemented research baseline:** seven states across Azeroth and separate relational Shadowlands and K’aresh worldspaces; 13 events; two five-phase strategic dossiers; deliberate visuals for the covenants, dragonflights, Xal'atath, and Khaz Algar's Earthen; and a 13-pane guided history. The current research cutoff includes the released Midnight invasion, Darkwell and Dawnwell outcomes, and the August 2026 Coiled Isle chapter. Later Worldsoul Saga outcomes remain open. See `docs/research/era-9-modern-cosmic-age.md` for the source-freshness boundary and review checklist.

## Story-animation authoring template

For questline stories using the same presentation and scene pattern, follow the [full storyline build guide](../research/storyline-build-template.md). The active [questline candidate slate](../research/questline-story-candidates.md) prioritizes substantial journeys and ends with Wrath of the Lich King. These research packets do not replace the era guides or constitute finished tours.

For each depicted place that exists in World of Warcraft, record the matching edition/build and the area's recognizable architecture, materials, colors, terrain, vegetation, skyline, and landmarks. Review the original interpretive scene art against that same game area and report the reference and review result in the asset ledger. Do not substitute generic fantasy scenery or another zone's visual language: Stormwind Keep should read as pale or white stone with blue and gold details, not red-brown stone and red banners.

Each tour node should answer one narrative question and produce one visible change:

```text
setup narration
→ camera instruction
→ highlight the people/place/battle being discussed
→ animate a cited route, domain, or map-state change
→ hold long enough for transcript/voice-over
→ fill the visible chapter timer
→ settle into a deterministic final state
→ advance automatically when the timer fills
```

Recommended node fields are already supported: narration, explicit duration, camera pose, record references, visual actions, and previous/next links. The atlas presents only Previous and Next controls during a tour; source records remain available through separate permanent dossiers. Future voice-over attaches to these nodes; transcript text remains authoritative and accessible.

Default tour pacing targets a slow, weighty 82 spoken words per minute with roughly five seconds of additional settling time for map and camera changes. Guided-tour panes remain a single continuous sequence; detailed conflict phases belong in their permanent battle dossiers, not inside the tour.
