# Guided voice-over production note

## Decision

Guided voice-over is an optional, repository-backed enhancement to StoryNode narration. The browser never calls a speech service. Authoring uses a reproducible Gradio generation script; the resulting MP3 files, duration metadata, hashes, and provenance are committed with the lore data.

Voice-over applies only to the continuous guided-history narration. Dossiers, interface labels, provenance panels, battle playback, and free exploration remain text-only.

## Performance direction

The voice is an original low male chronicler: mature, resonant, restrained, landscape-conscious, and unhurried. The desired weight and spacious cadence are broad tonal references; no Warcraft recording, character voice, or performer sample is used or imitated.

The original production set used Kokoro's `am_onyx` voice at speed `0.5` followed by another `0.9` tempo pass. Listening review rejected that result as unnaturally slow and difficult to understand.

The replacement production set uses Kokoro's stock British male `bm_lewis` voice at native speed `0.9`, selected from a fourteen-candidate audition spanning four model families. It receives loudness normalization only; no secondary tempo manipulation, reverb, pitch shift, voice cloning, or performer reference is used. The intended result is measured and authoritative without sacrificing natural cadence or intelligibility.

## Asset contract

- One MP3 per StoryNode under `public/audio/guided/<guide-id>/<node-id>.mp3`.
- Story data owns `assetPath`, measured duration, voice ID, and AI-generation disclosure.
- `public/audio/guided/manifest.json` records hashes, byte sizes, durations, and generator settings.
- `public/audio/guided/provenance.json` records model, license, voice, speed, disclosure, and the absence of reference audio.
- `pnpm generate:voiceovers` regenerates or resumes the corpus through `hexgrad/Kokoro-TTS`; `--force` replaces existing files and `--gpu` opts into the public accelerated queue.
- `pnpm generate:voiceovers --nodes=<comma-separated-node-ids> --force` replaces only edited narration cards and preserves the remaining tracks in the complete manifest.
- `pnpm validate:data` fails when a declared voice-over asset is absent.

## Playback contract

- Voice-over is off by default and begins only after a visitor enables it.
- The visible StoryNode narration remains the accessible transcript.
- Turning voice-over off pauses and resets the current clip; turning it on again starts that chapter from the beginning.
- Previous, Next, guide exit, era changes, and chapter changes interrupt the old clip before the replacement begins.
- With voice-over enabled, the audio `ended` event advances the guide. With it disabled, the existing text-duration timer advances the guide.
- The preference persists independently of story progress, so a visitor can turn narration off and back on throughout the tour.

## Validation performed

- 117 StoryNodes, 117 MP3 files, zero missing assets.
- The Lewis replacement corpus is approximately 50.4 minutes and 34.7 MiB, with measured duration and hashes recorded in `public/audio/guided/manifest.json`.
- Browser playback reached `readyState 4`, advanced `currentTime`, stopped on disable, restarted on re-enable, and loaded the next chapter's distinct MP3.
- A focused Playwright regression covers on, off, on again, and next-chapter playback.

## Azerothium wording refresh — 2026-09-25

Seven guided passages were rewritten to remove source-book framing from the spoken history: `adventurers-story-outland`, `black-empire-story-cosmos`, `black-empire-story-central-bastion`, `cosmic-origins-story-light-shadow`, `cosmic-origins-story-forces`, `modern-story-nzoth-falls`, and `modern-story-midnight-horizon`. Their MP3 files were regenerated through the existing production command using `bm_lewis` at speed `0.9`. The complete 117-track manifest retains the other 110 recordings and updates the seven replacement hashes, sizes, and measured durations.

All 117 manifest hashes and StoryNode duration/path pairs were checked; all seven replacements passed FFmpeg decoding. The silent-reading duration for the central bastion passage increased to 39.5 seconds to preserve the existing reading-pace contract. Source titles and citation IDs remain accurate; publication status remains research.

## Central-bastion narration revision

The central-bastion passage was subsequently rewritten as direct historical narration, removing the spoken cartography aside. Its single MP3 was rebuilt with `--nodes=black-empire-story-central-bastion --force` using the same Lewis voice and speed. The source record retains its approximate geography and research status; the manifest records the replacement audio hash and measured duration.

## Immersive narration pass — 2026-09-25

The guided corpus was read for asides about source analysis, uncertain cartography, symbolic figures, map states, and renderer behavior. Forty-three passages across all ten eras were rewritten to stay within the historical telling. Unsupported motives and geographic details were omitted rather than replaced with invented certainty. The Midnight passage retains an unresolved future horizon. Source, claim, geographic-certainty, and research-status records retain their existing editorial scope.

Replacement counts: Cosmic Origins 3; Black Empire 1; Ordering 2; Ancient Civilizations 2; War of the Ancients 4; Long Vigil 2; Rise of the Horde 5; Third War 7; Age of Adventurers 8; Modern Cosmic Age 9. The Dark Portal chapter is now titled “A gateway opens between worlds.”

The selected-node generation command uses the existing stock `bm_lewis` voice at native speed `0.9`, with loudness normalization and no extra tempo processing. All 43 corresponding MP3s are regenerated; the remaining 74 recordings are retained. The Black Empire expansion chapter's silent-reading duration is 42.5 seconds to accommodate its revised transcript.

## Prior-art lesson

The Ocarina of Trump repository established useful production discipline: deterministic filenames, authored manifests, provenance, normalization, duration awareness, and explicit interruption testing. Azerothium adopts those general safeguards while keeping its implementation web-native, opt-in, and independent of any ROM audio system.

## Classic-to-Wrath transcript alignment — 2026-10-02

A local Whisper `base.en` pass compared the visible narration with all 219 narrated scenes in the Classic-to-Wrath StoryTour. Ten recordings stopped before their final sentence: nine Scepter of the Shifting Sands scenes and one Fallen Hero scene. A second `small.en` pass confirmed those cutoffs. The manifest transcript hashes matched the current text, so the mismatch was inside the generated audio rather than a stale transcript fingerprint.

The voice generator now divides passages longer than 220 characters at sentence boundaries, synthesizes each part, and joins the WAV files before encoding the MP3. Those ten tracks were regenerated with the current narration. A post-generation `base.en` pass recognized each closing sentence; transcript and audio hashes, durations, and repository paths are recorded in the voice manifest. Automatic speech recognition is an alignment check, not human approval of pronunciation or performance.
