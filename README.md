# Azerothium

Azerothium is a desktop-first, time-aware 3D historical atlas for Warcraft lore. It is designed around eras, changing spatial states, structured battles, causal relationships, guided stories, and source provenance.

> **Unofficial fan project:** Azerothium is a fan-made interpretation of the Warcraft universe and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or approved by Blizzard Entertainment.

This repository implements the [product and technical specification](./docs/azeroth_3d_lore_atlas_product_technical_spec_UPDATED.docx). All ten eras contain source-linked `research` previews. None of this content should be treated as human-reviewed Warcraft canon yet.

## What works now

- Cinematic landing page with the full Mega Tour, a time estimate, and a Tours hub for era tours and the Classic-to-Wrath story map
- Vite, React, and TypeScript application shell
- React Three Fiber guided scenes with generated terrain, relational cosmography, uncertainty-aware regions, and sourced site markers; public camera and map-object interaction is disabled
- Ten Era tours in the Tours hub, beginning with a complete Cosmic Origins research prologue
- Separate Zustand stores for era, layers, selection, story, and source filters
- TypeScript domain contracts and Zod schemas
- File-backed repository adapter with cross-record validation
- Data-driven StoryNode action interpreter
- Source-linked research previews for all ten eras, from Cosmic Origins through the Modern Cosmic Age
- Optional voice-over for every guided chapter, with visible transcripts and an uninterrupted Mega Tour across the eras and playable storylines
- Unit tests, linting, type checks, CI, and Render static-site configuration

The full delivery sequence and architectural decisions are in [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](./docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md). The research, terrain, people, battle, and animated-tour program—including the implemented Cosmic Origins prologue—is in [`docs/eras/README.md`](./docs/eras/README.md).

Live GitHub Pages build: <https://ryeceps.github.io/azeroth-chronicle/>

## Local development

Requirements: Node.js 24 or newer and pnpm 11.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite. Useful routes include:

- `/map?era=cosmic-origins&tour=full`
- `/map?era=long-vigil-new-kingdoms&tour=era`
- `/archive`
- `/eras/black-empire`
- `/battles/elemental-assault-on-black-empire`

Keep `pnpm dev` running during implementation. Vite hot-reloads the open browser tab as source, styles, and data change, so routine iteration does not require restarting or reopening the application.

## Quality commands

```bash
pnpm validate:data
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm check
```

Browser acceptance: run `pnpm test:e2e:smoke` for eight representative scenarios. Normal CI runs this smoke suite. Run `pnpm test:e2e` for all browser scenarios and the renderer benchmark, or manually run the CI workflow with `full_browser_suite` enabled. Both commands build before starting locally. CI reuses its production build with `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BUILD=1`, runs acceptance with two workers, then runs the renderer benchmark alone. Set `PLAYWRIGHT_PORT` when another checkout uses the default port 4173. Failure screenshots and retry traces are retained; continuous video is disabled to avoid encoding large scenes throughout passing tests. All scene, image, transcript, layout, audio, and visual-baseline assertions still run. Human review screenshots are generated locally; set `PLAYWRIGHT_VISUAL_REVIEW=1` to generate them in CI too.

## Content rules

1. Research notes do not go directly into publishable summaries.
2. Every significant factual claim needs a source and citation.
3. Approximate, inferred, speculative, and unknown material must be labeled.
4. Do not copy source prose or scans into the public application.
5. Promote research records to reviewed or published status only after human lore review.

The editorial timeline uses *World of Warcraft: Chronicle* Volumes 1–4 as its backbone. In-world eras and boundaries are derived from the reviewed chronology in those volumes; a book volume is a source grouping, not automatically an in-world era.

## Deployment

The repository deploys GitHub Pages from `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`. That build supplies the repository base path and emits a `404.html` SPA fallback so direct dossier and map links work. `render.yaml` remains available for a Render Static Site deployment at the domain root. No backend, database, authentication, or secret-bearing client integration is required for the MVP.

## Project status

The reusable engine, ten-era navigation, and source-linked previews for Eras 0–9—from **Cosmic Origins** through **The Modern Cosmic Age**—are implemented. The public site remains an unofficial research preview, not a lore-reviewed publication: all ten slices are explicitly marked as research until their claims, citations, summaries, causal interpretations, cartography, and original visuals pass human review. See the current-status and content-gated sections of the implementation plan.
